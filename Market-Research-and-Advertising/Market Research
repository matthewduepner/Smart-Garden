“WaterMe! App”

Username: waterme!

Your personal gardening secretary
A couple friends and I have been developing a new product, WaterMe! which essentially acts as one’s own personal gardening secretary. WaterMe! connects our smart sensors to the user’s smartphone and reminds the user when to water and care for his/her plants. Using digital sensors, WaterMe! notifies the user via the WaterMe! smartphone app when the user’s house plants need watering. All the user needs to do is select his or her plant from our database of over 1000+ plants. The application will tell the user how to care for the plants.

What do you all think about a device that measures a plant's environment and helps people garden?

Response: Bren Haas
Hi Kevin - do you mean like a sensor that measures the plants moisture or a mobile app?

Kevin Kevin
Actually it would be both. The sensors that measure the plant's environment would send all of its information for the gardener to see on a mobile app.

Because I ALWAYS have my mobile phone with me ( ESPECIALLY in the garden) this tool you talk about would be awesome and I could see it being useful in the garden.

Hey guys, I am currently working on a school project and am wondering what you guys think of a product that helps gardeners by measuring a plant's environment. The device would measure when a plant needs water, and other measurements such as soil content and sunlight level. Please let me know if you guys would find this device helpful to gardeners. Thank you.
