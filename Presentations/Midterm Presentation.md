Outline:  
1.	Have a good problem statement  
2.	Explain the customer and how you will create value for them   
3.	Explain your progress  
4.	Explain your next steps  
  
Problems we wish to solve:  
*	It is hard to take care of a plant. 
*	People can be too busy.  
*	New gardeners might not know what their plants need to survive.
	
Our solution:

Our product makes taking care of plants easier -- monitors the plantâ€™s environment and notifies the user when to water the plant, using an online plant database.  CONTINUE STATING BENEFITS TO THE USER, not more information about the product -- never forget to water your plant, keep your plant alive, this is great for beginners, low cost.

What we have done so far:  
Bought parts  
Began prototyping  
Writing code

what do we plan to do next?

	make/finish a prototype - make sure hardware works, connect it to the internet
	make sure software works - logs data, sends notifications
	once it works, we will make our product more aesthetically pleasing
	MARKETING -- to see if people want this product (how large the market is), we will post on forums, etc. advertising our product - responses to our posts
