Context:

  Over the past few months, we’ve been working on WaterMe! The WaterMe! device is inserted directly into the soil near a plant and provides users with crucial information about a plant’s environment that they would otherwise lack. By monitoring the plants’ moisture levels, a watering schedule is determined. Our smartphone app will then remind users when their plants need to be watered and how to care for them.  All the user needs to do is select a plant from our database and WaterMe! does the rest.
  
  We created a prototype and then went on to test it in the real world. When we developed the concept of WaterMe, we assumed that consumers would see it as essential. We reached out to the online community to hear their thoughts and to test our assumptions. 
  
  We found This feedback by creating a website and a facebook page to connect with potential customers and spread our beta survey. We shared these pages on all kinds of forums and Social networks. Using facebook and google analytics, we learned about the habits of our site’s visitors. By observing this data, we realized that some of our tactics were favorable, while others weren’t. This helped us improve our outreach efforts and connect with the public more efficiently.
  
  Our feedback showed us that our original assumptions were not as legitimate as we expected. We noticed a trend in our responses that displayed a preference for an outdoor device. This challenged our initial design that was tailored for indoor house plants. As a result, we modified our design by building a waterproof and more durable frame so that the WaterMe system could be used outdoors as well. This is just one example of feedback that helped us improve our design. Other feedback showed us that some of our posts lacked clarity, so we went back and made the proper edits. Moving forward we plan on launching our kickstarter and making WaterMe a reality. Thank you.
