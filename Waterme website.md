Plants are too easy to kill. Each plant has a unique, fragile environment that is difficult to manage. People are often discouraged from gardening because of this. We are here to make gardening simple.
 
 Introducing Water Me
WaterMe monitors the plantsâ€™ moisture levels and environment to determine a watering schedule using sparkcore technology.  Using that information, WaterMe will remind you when a plant needs to be watered and how to care for it by sending a message to your smartphone.  All you need to do is select a plant from the database and WaterMe! does the rest.
