WaterMe
Goals: measure and share data online to determine plant maintenance
Requirements:
Plant database
Weather stream
Sensor logging
Data analysis
User interface and notifications

Components:
Spark Core
Sensors
Moisture ($15.50 for 4)
Light ($3.15 for 5 photoresistors)
Humidity / temperature ($9.00 for 5)
Temperature (thermocouple)
Power source
Enclosure

Steps:
Connect sensors to spark-core
Data logging
Push data to cloud
Analyze data
Communicate with user via app

**Automated watering
**battery powered by solar power
**BLE (bluetooth low energy) connected sensors
**New Feature: Prior to planting, WaterMe can be inserted into a pot of soil in your desired location.  The next day, the app will tell the user if the conditions are suitable and what plants will survive well.

Goal: Wifi connected sensors send data to a sparkcore and then to the web.  Using this data, a google-app-script will determine the best way to care for your plants.

Moisture sensor senses the water in the soil for the plant, every time it senses water it sends a timestamp, every # of hours sends a reminder for the usual watering.  Other sensors sends secondary information about recommendations for the plants condition.

“WaterMe! App”
Your personal gardening secretary

Busy day?
WaterMe! is your personal gardening assistant that reminds you to water your plants.

Using digital sensors, WaterMe! notifies the user via the WaterMe! smartphone app when the user’s house plants need watering! This information is presented in the app through easy to read visual displays.

WaterMe! will determine the best way to care for a variety of plants.  All the user needs to do is select his or her plant from our database of over 1000+ plants. The application will tell the user how to care the plants.

Presentation
Have a good problem statement
Explain the customer and how you will create value for them 
Explain your progress
Explain your next steps

what are we making?
-problem
	It is hard to take care of a plant.  People can be too busy.  New gardeners might not know what their plants require from the environment to live.
-solution/product, why people would buy this
Our product makes taking care of plants easier -- monitors the plant’s environment and notifies the user when to water the plant, using an online plant database.  CONTINUE STATING BENEFITS TO THE USER, not more information about the product -- never forget to water your plant, keep your plant alive, this is great for beginners, low cost
what have we done so far?
	bought parts
	began prototyping
	writing code
what do we plan to do next?
	make/finish a prototype - make sure hardware works, connect it to the internet
	make sure software works - logs data, sends notifications
	once it works, we will make our product more aesthetically pleasing
	MARKETING -- to see if people want this product (how large the market is), we will post on forums, etc. advertising our product - responses to our posts

Projection based off of a plant database?
