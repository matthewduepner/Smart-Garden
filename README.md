WaterMe!

Goals: measure and share data online to determine plant maintenance

Requirements:
	Plant database
	Weather stream
	Sensor logging
	Data analysis
	User interface and notifications

Future Additions/variations that we would add/change:
**Automated watering

**battery powered by solar power
**BLE (bluetooth low energy) connected sensors
**Prior to planting, WaterMe can be inserted into a pot of soil in your desired location.  The next day, the app will tell the user if the conditions are suitable and what plants will survive well.
