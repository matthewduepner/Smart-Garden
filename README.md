WaterMe!

Goals: measure and share data online to determine plant maintenance

Requirements:
	Plant database
	Weather stream
	Sensor logging
	Data analysis
	User interface and notifications

Possible Future/Ambitious Features:
**Automated watering

**battery powered by solar power
**BLE (bluetooth low energy) connected sensors
**Prior to planting, WaterMe can be inserted into a pot of soil in your desired location.  The next day, the app will tell the user if the conditions are suitable and what plants will survive well.

Table of Contents (by ABC order):
Bill of Materials - List of the parts and cost of the necessary components to build a theoretical prototype. 

Coding Guide - We have contacted both professors and upper classmen regarding the procedure of coding WaterMe!. The conversation via email is supplied in this file. Using the information from these conversations, we established a general outline for approaching how to code both the device and app.

Market Research - Our approach on how to put WaterMe! into the real world. We have posted on various forums which can be seen in this file. We also have developed a google survey (which the link is included in each forum post) to gather the interest for our device. 

Midterm presentation - Outline of the presentation that was presented in class which summarizes our processes up to this point and what are next steps are for WaterMe!.

sparkcore program - Although not started we intend on using the advice from upperclassmen and professors as well as any useful tutorials to develop this program.

Useful links - List of helpful links gathered during the research process
