Hello, a couple friends and I from The Cooper Union are working on a school project: “WaterMe!” and we’d like to hear your opinion on our product. Essentially, what our device does is it sets up watering schedules that are unique to each plant and displays this information on a smartphone application. All you need to do is insert our device into the soil near your plant/s, choose the plant from our database (which contains specific information unique to each plant species), and WaterMe! does the rest. Every plant receives its own “personal” treatment based on its own unique requirements. Also, to add a little spice, you can name your plants! 

For example, say you have an Aloe Vera plant in your living room. All you need to do is log in to our user-friendly smartphone application, select “Aloe Vera” from our plant database, and insert the WaterMe! device into the soil near your plant. The user can give this plant a funky name, like ‘Spike’, and receive ‘WaterMe!’ notifications from Spike via the WaterMe! application.

We are in the process of determining our prices. For now, we need help spreading the word and figuring out if people would be interested in purchasing our product. We are passionate gardeners and we want to share this passion with the world. We are reaching out to the gardening community to join our mission. 

Our goal is to make the gardening process fun and simple, and we are always welcoming input from the gardening community on how to do so! We are eager to hear everyone’s questions and comments! It would be amazing if you can write about us and spread our idea! Any assistance can help! Thank you!
