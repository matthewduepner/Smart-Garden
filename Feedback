Feedback and the Inferences we have made

We posted on the National Gardening Association forum, and we received multiple responses.  Bren Haas, one lifelong gardening expert, revealed that there was some ambiguity with what our device actually was.  Noticing her old age, we realized that the age of our potential customers can vary significantly.  So, in the development of our website and our presented information in emails and on Facebook, we meticulously ensured that our presentation is precise and clear.  Upon further discussion with Ms. Haas, she emphasized that she always carried her smartphone with her while she tends her garden.  Thus we can make a generalization that gardeners, even of her age group, are willing to use new technologies.  Lynn, another gardener, said that beginners and experts alike would benefit from our product.  This means that our customers can range from young to old and from beginners to experts.
