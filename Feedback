Feedback and the Inferences we have made

We posted on the National Gardening Association forum, and we received multiple responses.  Bren Haas, one lifelong gardening expert, revealed that there was some ambiguity with what our device actually was.  Noticing her old age, we realized that the age of our potential customers can vary significantly.  So, in the development of our website and our presented information in emails and on Facebook, we meticulously ensured that our presentation is precise and clear.  Upon further discussion with Ms. Haas, she emphasized that she always carried her smartphone with her while she tends her garden.  Thus we can make a generalization that gardeners, even of her age group, are willing to use new technologies.  Lynn, another gardener, said that beginners and experts alike would benefit from our product.  This means that our customers can range from young to old and from beginners to experts.

Additionally, we posted on the Garden Web forum claimed to be “the internet’s largest home and garden community.” After describing our product idea and the functionality we were met with responses from gardeners. One posed the question of other devices and products that are currently on the market and how we differentiate our product from those. Thus, we learned the importance of showing how our product is different from known devices such as Edyn (which is currently on Kickstarter). We responded by emphasizing that our product can work both outdoors and indoors, on specific plants giving personal treatment and monitoring for a specific plant. We also stressed the low cost relative to other devices as well as how easy the setup for WaterMe really is unlike other complex and intricate installations. 

We also used facebook analytics for the facebook page and google analytics for the waterme website.
Currently waiting on responses from emails to blog writers and responses from our waterme updates from our email list.
