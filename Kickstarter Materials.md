PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  

Use your project description to share more about what you’re raising funds to do and how you plan to pull it off. It’s up to you to make the case for your project.  
  
The problem today is that many people are disinterested in gardening because of how much work it is and how boring it can be. Every plant has its own unique requirements and caring for them can be complicated.  
  
But don't stress!  
  
We are here to make the process fun and simple.  
  
No matter who you are, or where you stand as a gardener, WaterMe! takes you to the next level.  
The device provides users with crucial information about a plant’s environment that they would otherwise lack.

The WaterMe! sensors are placed in the soil and connect directly to the user's smartphone. By monitoring the plants’ moisture levels a watering schedule can be determined accordingly. The WaterMe! algorithms analyze the plants' environmental data and use it to build a watering schedule that maximizes gardening efficiency.  

Basically, WaterMe! reminds users when a plant needs to be watered and shows the user how to care for the plants. All the user needs to do is select a plant from our database and WaterMe! does the rest  

Our next step is to raise enough funds to put in our first production order. Lets work together to revolutionize the gardening industry and spread the beauty of XYZ around the world.  
Welcome the gardening revolution!
