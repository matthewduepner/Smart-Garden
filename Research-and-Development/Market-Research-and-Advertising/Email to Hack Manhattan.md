Dear Hack Manhattan,  

I am currently working on an IOT related school project called WaterMe!  The goal of our project is to simplify the process of caring for household plants by monitoring their environment.  Using data collected by sensors inserted into the soil, our smartphone app will determine an optimal watering schedule according to the needs of each plant.  To further simplify the process we are working on a database full of plants to choose from.  

In case you are interested, the hardware consists of a Spark Core and several sensors including a humidity/temperature sensor, a photoresistor, and most importantly a moisture sensor.
